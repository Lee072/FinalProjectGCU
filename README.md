# SeniorProject

This is my final senior project at GCU. It is a multi-page web application that mimics a home security website where users can manage their security devices. 
The first (Home) page shows recenctly alerted devices and a image related to that alert. The second shwos a whole table of all devices being used in the system. 
The final page is a settings page where the user can toggle light and dark modes.
